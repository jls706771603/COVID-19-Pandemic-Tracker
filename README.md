The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant global health concern that is gaining attention across the world. It's critical to keep up with the most recent data in your area. Also, understanding about the COVID-19 pattern might help people plan for their work-life balance during the pandemic. In fact, various public COVID-19-related data sets are available online. Updated case data is valuable to examine in order to identify the major elements involved in cases and what the trends are for each country, state, and county.

In this project, we will develop a website that will track and present trends for selected countries/cities utilizing official COVID-19 data in order to obtain deeper insights and statistics. If possible, we want to combine trending findings with COVID-19 social media exposure to enhance our datasets. The desired output of this project would be a well-designed website based on cleaned COVID-19 related datasets, as well as an analytical report with visualizations employing enhanced ML approaches.
